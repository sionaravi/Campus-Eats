# Campus Eats

Campus Eats is an android app which is designed to allow student and falculty to place orders for food from campus dining 
locations no matter where they are on campus. It gives students options for jobs, as the food ordered by students or 
faculty will be delivered by students or faculty, and potentially allows more people to order food than normal since it
is more convenient for kids who have class to place an order instead of having to go out of their way to find a dining 
location.

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, Android Studio and CocoaPods/Chocolatey.

* Install Node and Watchman using Homebrew.<br/>
    brew install node <br/>
    brew install watchman

* React Native uses 2.7.6 of Ruby. Update your .ruby-version using Ruby version manager like rbenv,RVM,chruby.
	Installation of rbenv on macOs can be done through homebrew:<br/>
	brew install rbenv ruby-build <br/>
	rbenv install 2.7.6

* Install bundle using:
 	"bundle install" command

* Install Android Studio.
* Install Command line tools in Terminal.
* Install CocoaPods using homebrew<br/>
	brew install cocoapods.

## Running

Open the Android folder in Android and run the project, from either a terminal or Android Studio itself.

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.




# Testing - 492

In 492, you will write automated tests. When you do, you will need to add a section that explains how to run them.

The unit and behavioral tests are in the __tests__ folder in the unit-testing branch.

To download all the required dependencies, run:

npm install

To run all the tests in the __tests__ folder, run:

npm test


## Testing Technology - 492

We are using Jest, a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications, to write and execute automated tests for our React Native screens. To install Jest, run:

npm install jest --save-dev


## Running Tests - 492

To run the tests using Jest, execute the following command in your terminal:


npm test


Jest will execute each test case and provide you with the results in the console. If all tests pass, you'll see a green checkmark, indicating that your screen is working as expected. If any tests fail, Jest will provide detailed information about the failure, allowing you to identify and fix any issues.
